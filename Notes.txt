Q) Why Use static imports in Rest_Assured? 
Ans - For code readability. Otherwise we need to use RestAssured class to import the 
methods like - RestAssured.given().when().then()

Which hampers the code readability. 

Q) Why Method Chaining in Rest Assured? 
Ans - It's similar to cucumber BDD approach

All the given(), when(), then() - return object of same class which implements Request Specification interface. Because of this we can chain them
